## Prerequisites

### Runner Self-Hosted
You have to use the **self-hosted runner** to deploy your app in the specific environment.

### COPS URL
We suggest adding COPS url as repository secret.

### Image URL
You can use the image from some other action output or something else. The image can be from different sources as long as COPS is able to use it.
